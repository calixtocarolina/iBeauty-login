<p> The iBeauty login website was made using simple tools to create a clean appearance for the user/client to log in or sign on. It can fit the all types of needs, so feel free to use the design and readjust! </p>

<p><b>Technologies used:</b></p>
<li> HTML</li>
<li> CSS</li>
<li> Vanilla JS (JavaScript)</li>

<p><strong>Configurations:</strong></p>

<p>After cloning this repository, maybe you'll want to do some changes on the style or major changes that'll require the usage of some framework or library. I'll recommend <b>Bootstrap</b> for CSS components and <b>React.js</b> if you want to implement more sophisticated aspects for the user's interaction. 

The <b>iBeauty Login Website</b> is aired and can be viewed <a href="https://ibeautylogin.netlify.app/">here</a>.
